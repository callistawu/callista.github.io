My non-existent portfolio contains a lot of different mediums: graphic design, editorial design, photography, painting, industrial design, etc. and I have never been able to find a portfolio that displays the content that I want in the way that I want.

So my goal is to build my own!

This might take up to three years, idk. But hopefully one day I will have created something that can be the home to everything else I've created.
